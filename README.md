### Story - The Ant and the Grasshopper

Once upon a time, there was an ant who worked hard all summer gathering food for the winter. She stored grain, seeds, and nuts in her anthill to last through the cold months ahead.

One day, while the ant was busy gathering food, a grasshopper came along. The grasshopper saw the ant working hard and asked, "Why are you working so hard, ant? Come and play with me instead."

The ant replied, "I can't play with you, grasshopper. I have to gather food for the winter so that I can survive."

The grasshopper laughed and said, "Winter? Don't worry about winter, ant. Live in the moment and enjoy life."

The ant ignored the grasshopper and continued to work hard, but the grasshopper spent his days singing and dancing and having fun.
